# Deep Convolutionl Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) for Mammogram Data Augmentation
## This project contains my final scripts both written in Python and Jupyter Notebook, as well as image results

### A) Model 1: Healthy  Infilling Model
### B) Model 2: Tumor Generation BC Model
### C) Model 3: Class Conditional Image Infilling & Tumor Generation DCGAN Model
### D) Model 4: Residual Network 50-like (Resnet-50) architecture on Real and Augmented Data
